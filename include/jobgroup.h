 * Description:  
 * 1. Creates a linked list of processes that act as wrappers to the threads
 * to provide the threads additional information such as threadID and groupID.  The parent
 * process along with its children processes are put into a job when those threads become backgrounded
 * by typing in a & at the end of a command.  
 * 2. It checks to see if the job with the given jobID exists
 * in the job list for job control shell functionality such as kill, suspending, foregrounding, and backgrounding
 * and returns the index of that job in the list.
 * 3. It also prints out the list of jobs and the processes in those jobs.
 * 4. For debugging purposes, you can print out the threads in the thread table.
